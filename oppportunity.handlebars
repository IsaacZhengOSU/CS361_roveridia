          <p>Opportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover â€“ B) or MER-1, and nicknamed "Oppy," is a
            robotic rover that was active on Mars from 2004 until mid-2018. Opportunity was operational on Mars for
            5110 sols (5250 days; 14 years, 136 days). Launched on July 7, 2003, as part of NASA's Mars Exploration
            Rover program, it landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin Spirit (MER-A)
            touched down on the other side of the planet. With a planned 90-sol duration of activity (slightly less
            than 92.5 Earth days), Spirit functioned until it got stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, while
            Opportunity was able to stay operational for 5111 sols after landing, maintaining its power and key systems
            through continual recharging of its batteries using solar power, and hibernating during events such as dust
            storms to save power. This careful operation allowed Opportunity to operate for 57 times its designed
            lifespan, exceeding the initial plan by 14 years, 46 days (in Earth time). By June 10, 2018, when it last
            contacted NASA, the rover had traveled a distance of 45.16 kilometers (28.06 miles).

            Mission highlights included the initial 90-sol mission, finding meteorites such as Heat Shield Rock
            (Meridiani Planum meteorite), and over two years of exploring and studying Victoria crater. The rover
            survived moderate dust storms and in 2011 reached Endeavour crater, which has been described as a "second
            landing site." The Opportunity mission is considered one of NASA's most successful ventures.

            Due to the planetary 2018 dust storm on Mars, Opportunity ceased communications on June 10 and entered
            hibernation on June 12, 2018. It was hoped it would reboot once the weather cleared, but it did not,
            suggesting either a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust had covered its solar panels. NASA hoped to
            re-establish contact with the rover, citing a windy period that could potentially clean off its solar
            panels. On February 13, 2019, NASA officials declared that the Opportunity mission was complete, after
            the spacecraft had failed to respond to over 1,000 signals sent since August 2018.</p>
